# BYOD Registration Form

Project Overview: <br>
As part of the HFA onboarding process, I completed the HFA BYOD Ingest Form—a project designed to document and analyze the technical specifications of my personal computing device. This hands-on assignment required a detailed, two- to three-page report that not only captured my device's specifications but also provided an explanation of its capabilities.
<br><br>
Project Objectives: <br>
- Cataloging Device Specifications: In the first section, I gathered and recorded detailed technical specifications of my personal BYOD computing device.
- Analytical Insight: In the second section, I provided an in-depth explanation of these specifications, exploring what they reveal about the device’s performance and capabilities.
- Practical Investigation: The project involved investigating the device’s internals, learning how to locate system information using various operating system tools.
- Visual Documentation: A key component was including a screenshot of the system information, which served as evidence of my findings.
